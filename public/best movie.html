<h1>The Best Movies According to Wing</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Book of Eli</h3>
<p>A fiction movie about the post nuclear activated world where humanity's morals and hope are declining, but a new hope is arising from the book which the protaganist, Eli holds. </p>

<h3>Eraser</h3>
<p>Old movie from the 90's where technologies are starting to take shape for better future. The main actor was Arnold Swarzheneggar(?) where he acts as a professional in "erasing" the profile of the target by faking their deaths and give them new identidies. It was the first advanced weapon showed towards the end of the movie made this movie the coolest.</p>

<h3>The Mask</h3>
<p>Probably the one movie that made me like Jim Carrey as a comedian actor and influenced me for trying to be a comedian like him during my childhood times. </p>
